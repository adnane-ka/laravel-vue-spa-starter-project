## why this repo?
while working with vueJS, TailwindCSS and laravel i've noticed that i'm always repeating some steps that were necessary on initializing a full stack web app that uses laravel as an API and vueJS as a single page application (SPA). so in this repo i've tried to provide functionality for all the needed & common tools to do so and avoide working on the same thing again and again. this starter project provides: 

* Custom JSON error handling on backend.
* Direct interaction with views & components in VueJS.
* Direct interaction with layouts in VueJS.
* Direct interaction with Vue Router.
* A clean approach to deal with middlewares on front end.
* Direct interaction with axios as a promised-based HTTP client.
* Direct interaction with TailwindCSS as a css framework.
* Default handlers & direct interaction with dark/light mode.
* A well-designed and organized structure to clean your code.
* Direct interaction with localization and languages with helper functions using i18n.
* Direct interaction with sass as a Css preprocessor.
* Lazy loaded views & components.
